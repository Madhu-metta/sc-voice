### Welcome to SuttaCentral Voice! 

This app is being developed for those using screen readers such as JAWS, NVDA, and ChromeVox, but, sighted users may also find it a helpful way to explore the teachings of the Buddha. 

SuttaCentral Voice allows people to hear the Buddha's words through an audio reader fine tuned to the texts that preserve them. The app is a companion to <a href="https://suttacentral.net" target="_blank">SuttaCentral</a>; a website dedicated to making a vast ocean of Early Buddhist Texts freely available. The four main collections of Pali language discourses—about which you can find out more below—and their segmented translations published by SuttaCentral are the primary focus of SuttaCentral Voice.
