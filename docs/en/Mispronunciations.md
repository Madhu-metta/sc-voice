problems. Mispronounced homographs can only be fixed by Amazon.

### English other mispronunciations (Raveena)

* "keeping what they’ve learned" - says "earned". *This is an [AWS bug](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=297531) with no current resolution*
* "marriages"; ([example](https://voice.suttacentral.net/scv/index.html?r=0.009784745629357494#/sutta?search=dn1%2Fen%2Fbodhi): DN1, Bodhi, 6/21, 61/94).
* Hilariously, `:)` (as per: `(He recalls:) ‘Then I…` ) is read as "smile"; ([example](https://voice.suttacentral.net/scv/index.html?r=0.009784745629357494#/sutta?search=dn1%2Fen%2Fbodhi): DN1, Bodhi, 7/21, 7/20).
