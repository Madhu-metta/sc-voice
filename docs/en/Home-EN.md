### Welcome! 
Search for and hear the words of the Buddha with 
[Voice](https://voice.suttacentral.net).
[Voice](https://voice.suttacentral.net) 
is a companion website for [SuttaCentral](voice.suttacentral.net),
which hosts the vast ocean of Early Buddhist Texts (aka. "EBTs") 
and their translations into contemporary languages, making them
freely available to all.
Voice is designed to be 
[audio accessible](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility)
and extends the SuttaCentral texts with full support for 
TTS readers such as JAWS, NVDA, and ChromeVox. 
However, sighted users will also find it a helpful way 
to explore and study the teachings of the Buddha. 

In the time of the Buddha, the Dhamma was heard, 
memorized and spoken for others. 
Indeed, the hearing, memorization and speaking of the 
Dhamma was a key part of the practice.

These five things lead to the continuation, persistence, and enduring of the true teaching.  What five?
> * It’s when the mendicants memorize the teaching—
statements, songs, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of past lives, amazing stories, and classifications. This is the first thing that leads to the continuation, persistence, and enduring of the true teaching.</br>

> * Furthermore, the mendicants think about and consider the teaching in their hearts, examining it with their minds as they learned and memorized it.
This is the fifth thing that leads to the continuation, persistence, and enduring of the true teaching.

### Using SuttaCentral Voice
The simplest way to use [Voice](https://voice.suttacentral.net) is to click 
<kbd>Inspire Me!</kbd>. This will bring up a small selection of related suttas for you to select:

<a href="/sc-voice/assets/img/inspire-me.png"><img
    src="/sc-voice/assets/img/inspire-me.png?raw=true" style="height:4em"/></a>

You can also enter searches of your own, such as <kbd>root of suffering</kbd> and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>

To find a particular sutta such as MN1, simply enter "mn1" in the search field. To find several suttas at once, separate the sutta references with a comma (for example, “an8.71 <span aria-label="comma"> </span><span aria-hidden="true">,</span> mn32 <span aria-label="comma"> </span><span aria-hidden="true">,</span> dn21”). If you’d like to have some suttas suggested to you click on the “Inspire Me!” button. You can change the reading voice and other settings via the gear icon on the top right of the app. <a href="/sc-voice/en/ToC" target="_blank">Find the ToC for more information.</a>
